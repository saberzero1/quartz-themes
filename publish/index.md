# Obsidian Publish ❤️ Quartz Themes

> [!warning] Work in progress
> Style Settings is currently partially supported. Not all bindings carry over correctly at the moment. A fix to better address this is being worked on.

> Quartz with Quartz Themes

[Quartz Themes](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-themes) is a project that aims to port all Obsidian themes styles to [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), including support for the highly-popular [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

Theme support for Obsidian Publish is rather sparse, with only a handful of themes providing and maintaining a dedicated `publish.css` file. Obsidian Publish doesn't support the Style Settings plugin either. [There is a workaround for this](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/apply-style-settings-to-publish-theme/98440?u=saberzero1), but it leverages `publish.js`, which requires configuring a custom domain for Obsidian Publish.

To address these issues, and to give back to the community, every Obsidian theme that is converted for Quartz will also have a matching `publish.css` for use with Obsidian Publish.

This site showcases all converted themes. Simply navigate to the page of the associated theme and the styling should update to reflect how the theme will look using Obsidian Publish.

Finally, every page will link to a folder in the Quartz Themes repository containing the Quartz stylesheet and the `publish.css` file. This folder also includes the license of the original Obsidian theme and any author links and/or donation links if the theme author included them in their `manifest.json`.

Quartz Themes is licensed under an MIT license, while the generated themes are licensed under the same license as the original theme they are generated from. An overview can be found [in this table](https://github.com/saberzero1/quartz-themes?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-themes).
