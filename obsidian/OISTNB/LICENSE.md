### Preamble: Welcome to Your Life Sentence

By using this theme, you hereby surrender all rights to a normal, well-adjusted digital existence. Congratulations, you played yourself.

### Section 1: Terms of Incarceration

1. You are granted the right to use this theme, much like you're "granted" the right to use a rusty spoon in the cafeteria.

2. Redistribution is allowed, but only if you can smuggle it out in a place we'd rather not mention.

3. Modification is permitted, but remember: snitches get stitches, and bad mods get reformatted.

### Section 2: Warranties (or Lack Thereof)

This theme comes with absolutely no warranty. It's like expecting gourmet cuisine in solitary confinement â€“ keep dreaming, pal.

The creators of this theme are not responsible for:
   a) Eyestrain
   b) Carpal tunnel syndrome
   c) Existential dread

### Preamble: Welcome to Your Life Sentence

By using this theme, you hereby surrender all rights to a normal, well-adjusted digital existence. Congratulations, you played yourself.

### Section 4: Termination

This license, much like your hopes and dreams, can be terminated at any time without notice. Deal with it.

### Section 5: Governing Law

This license is governed by the law of the jungle, survival of the fittest, and occasionally, when we're feeling generous, admiralty law.

### Section 6: Acceptance

By using this theme, you accept all terms of this license. Not that you had a choice, really. It's this or the "My Little Pony" theme your coworker recommended.

Remember, in the grand penitentiary of productivity, you're here for life. Make it a good one.
